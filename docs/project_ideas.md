# Caio Montilha Senior Project

## Idea 1: Ridesharing App for the College Community
This project involves the creation of a ride-sharing app adapted to a college community. The platform will allow students and professors to offer and find 
rides to locations near the campus and nearby regions. The app will include features such as user verification, a rating system, and secure communication 
within the app to ensure a safe and user-friendly experience.

## Idea 2: Augmented Reality App
This project aims to develop an augmented reality application that provides users with an interactive experience similar to “Pokémon Go” or virtual try-on 
applications such as those from Adidas. The application can focus on educational content, games, or practical uses such as virtual product demonstrations, 
engaging users through immersive real-world interactions reinforced by digital overlays.

## Idea 3: Budget-Tracker Web
This project involves developing a user-friendly web-based tool for tracking and managing personal finances. As a student and business management enthusiast, 
having a well-organized budget is crucial for financial success. The application will allow users to input income and expenses, categorize transactions, set 
savings goals, and visualize their financial health through graphs and reports. The goal is to create a simple yet effective tool that helps users maintain 
control over their financial situation.
