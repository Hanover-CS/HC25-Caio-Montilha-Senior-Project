## Idea 1
### Ridesharing Platform for the College Community
Develop a secure and user-friendly system that allows members of the college community to offer and seek rides within the campus or to nearby locations. 
It could include features such as user verification, a rating system, and direct communication options to facilitate the efficient and safe organization of rides.
